# B2M Application Challange

Hello!

This is my solution for my challenge, I used ReactJS.

NOTE: Known to work with node v0.10.* and npm v2

### Run
You run this code by installing deps:
```
npm i
```

And then:
```
./node_modules/.bin/gulp
```

Open http://localhost:3001

### Lint and Test
You can check code via `eslint` by typing:
```
./node_modules/.bin/gulp lint
```

You can run tests (which are really few, unfortunately I did not have enough time to write more) with:
```
./node_modules/.bin/gulp test
```


# Enjoy!

Cheers.
